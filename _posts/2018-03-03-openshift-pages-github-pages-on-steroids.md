## Intro ##


## Why do People use Github Pages?  ##

- Git push based deploy
- Background regeneration
- Stability & reliability
- Free

## Why use OpenShift Instead? ##

- Plugins
- Contact forms & other dynamic data
- Extensibility via Sinatra
- Also free
- Hosted by red hat... should be comparable/better in reliability to Github

## Implementation  ##


## Results ##

- Regenerated small site in 103s
- Potential disadvantage if you need constant, quick regeneration on the live site... most people would be building locally however, so this is not a huge problem.
