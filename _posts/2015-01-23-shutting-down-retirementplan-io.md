All told, I have been working on RetirementPlan.io in some form or another for a few years. Yesterday, I shut down the website.

I launched this application as a true startup corporation, and was even featured as "Startup of the Week" in the Calgary Herald. Unfortunately the Canadian Financial Regulations are not quite ready for 100% algorithmic financial advice (unlike in the U.S.) so I had to shelve this project.  Good learning experience in any case!

The first version of this software was my first real web application.  It started as a means to learn [Ruby on Rails][Rails] and scratch a personal itch related to finance, retirement planning and statistics.  It grew from there into a full-fledged customer-facing application, incorporating individual user input, modern financial research and portfolio tracking.

The math side of the application was fairly complex... I ended up using all of the following in some fashion:

- Inverse Normal & Student's T distributions
- Cholesky decompositions
- Confidence Intervals
- Monte Carlo statistical simulations
- Regression and analysis of historical ETF returns
- Modern Portfolio Theory (portfolio variance & expected return)
- Reverse portfolio optimization


I have obviously also tied some of the marketing pieces together for this application - namely Google Analytics, Mailchimp, transactional e-mail and some other minor integrations.
