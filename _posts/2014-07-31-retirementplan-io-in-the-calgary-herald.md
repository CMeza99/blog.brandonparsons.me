RetirementPlan.io was recently featured as Calgary Herald's [Startup of the Week](http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2014/07/21/startup-of-the-week-retirementplan-io/)!

>There is a rapidly growing market of people who are tired of paying a portion of their assets annually to someone to manage their retirement planning. Enter RetirementPlan.io, an online Do-It-Yourself service that provides asset allocation, retirement modeling and portfolio tracking tools to help you purchase Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) through discount brokerages, at a fraction of the cost.

This article was a nice boost for RetirementPlan.io, and is certainly helping to get the word out.  A big thanks to Lloyed Lobo and the Calgary Herald!
