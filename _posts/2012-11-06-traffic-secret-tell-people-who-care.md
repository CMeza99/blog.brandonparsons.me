Something I discovered recently - you can't just sit back and write, and expect people to listen to what you have to say. Not so much a discovery, more so a realization that what people tell you *over and over* is truly correct.

I've written a few posts on this blog, usually with very little traffic.  I wrote one decently [useful post on dev/prod parity using Vagrant/Chef](http://brandonparsons.me/2012/vagrant-and-chef-for-ubuntu-deployment-server/) and on a whim shared it with Peter Cooper from [the Ruby Show](http://rubyshow.com/) and [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/). 

Lo-and-behold, sharing my content with people **who actually care** worked! I got over 1,300 visits to this page within a few days, my first blog comments, and even requests for a followup (I ended up following up with my [custom Chef/Ubuntu recipes](http://brandonparsons.me/2012/chef-recipes-for-rails-deployment/).)

If you find yourself spending hours on carefully crafted posts and nobody is coming to read it - give some thought to who would truly benefit from what you have to share.
